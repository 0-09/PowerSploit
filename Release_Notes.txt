----------

* All the features of PowerSyringe have now been split up into separate scripts which now fall under the PowerSploit project.
* Completely rewrote the PowerSyringe code from scratch.
* All scripts are now in conformance with proper PowerShell verb-noun agreement.
* All the scripts are entirely memory-resident now. This feature is possible through reflection. For more information on the implementation details, read my blog post: http://www.exploit-monday.com/2012/05/accessing-native-windows-api-in.html
* Improved error handing. Error handlers should pick up on every fault now.
* Added calls to VirtualFree for proper cleanup.
* Detailed output is now displayed when the -Verbose option is enabled.
* CreateThread assembly stub is now implemented in a function and is much more readable.
